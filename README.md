This repository contains our experiments related to the paper we submitted in APSIPA Transactions on Signal and Information Processing. The title of paper is "Psycho-linguistic differences among competing vaccination communities on social media." All the tweet IDs used in this research has been uploaded on OSF. The DOI is: (https://osf.io/FSM23/) We conclude the software we used in this repository: python, Gephi, LIWC. The python code within jupyter notebook mainly includes two parts: network analysis and linguistic analysis. Network analysis includes how we construct the retweet network, how we measure network and to find specific users. Linguistic analysis includes how we collect and filter the texts, how we preprocess text for LIWC, and the statistical methods we used. At last, we use Wordcloud to find the usage of subcategories in LIWC. And the software.ipynd includes how we use Gephi and LIWC to get clustering and linguistic score. The hyperlinks with these softwares also attached.
